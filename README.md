# Udacity_Nanodegree_ML_Smartcab

This is a Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree project. 

Given the traffic informantion and the destination, the smartcab should be trained to arrive at the destination as quickly as possible while break the fewest traffic rules.

Reinforcement learning is used here.
